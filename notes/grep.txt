history | grep -c "||"  -> counts how many times i had used the or connecting operator on the history of 
														my terminal

history | grep -i "CD" -> shows all the times i had used "cd" or "CD" or "cD" or  "Cd"
history | grep -i -c "CD" -> same that before but counting instead of showind
history | grep -vi -c "CD" -> this will count all the commands in which i had not used any "cd" ignoring capital case or lower case
