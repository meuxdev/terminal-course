BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND
===================================

cat > random_note.txt

CRTL + z -> suspended the task and goes to background


jobs -> shows all the process 
		
		with the process number that appears with the jobs commands we can run the command. 

		fg %1
				%<number>

				this way your process will return to the foreground and you will see that.

adding a "& operator" will send directly the process to background

	in my case when i open vscode the process keeps running in my terminal 

	$ code ./
	 ruuning............

	 $ code ./ & 
	 		passes the process to background
