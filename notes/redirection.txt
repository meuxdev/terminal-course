NOTES FOR REDIRECTIONS ON TERMINAL
--------------------------------

ls Videos/  videos_list.tx  -> redirection the ouput to a file videos_list.txt

 echo "CSS FILES" > files_list.txt -> redirection the output of echo to a file

 ls css >> files_list.txt -> append the files in the folder CSS on the files 
                              >> 
                              doble greater is used to append and not to re-write

 ls css > files_list.txt -> if we only use one ">" we can loose the prev text

 ls *.html >> files_list.txt -> you can also convine this with the wild cards

 ls static-txt >> files_list.txt -> ">>" used to append

Directory "aslkdfasldkfnaksld"  DOES NOT exist so this will show and ouput of type error.
  Error uses the channel 2 for communications.

ls aslkdfasldkfnaksld 2> error.txt -> will save the error output in a file
      
ls maybe-exists > output.txt 2>&1 -> if you are not sure if the dir exist you can add to the end of the
                                     command the char "2>&1" this to indicate to accept both intup channels.


 ls static-txt/notes_* > notes_list.txt 2>&1 -> also can be used with the wildcards
